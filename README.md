# Morning-Kata
After the bootcamp we decided with several junior web developers to create a morning kata club. 
The goal is to get together and work on the same kata and then explain the solutions we have found. 

The kata in the 'kataClub' folder were achieved in this context. 

The kata in the 'kata' folder were done outside this context.
