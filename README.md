# Morning-Kata ☕ :computer:
After the bootcamp we decided with several junior web developers to create a morning kata club. 
The goal is to get together, work on the same kata and then explain the solutions we have found. 

The kata in the 'kater-klub' folder were achieved in this context. 

When I can't join the kater-klub, I'm doing kata by myself (folder kata).
